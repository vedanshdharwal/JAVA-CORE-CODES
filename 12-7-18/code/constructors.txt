Constructor
-----------------
1) method like bodies having same name as their class name and
    no return type not even void also.

2) may or may not have arguments.

3) varargs can also be taken for constructors.

4) can be overloaded also.

5) they are called implicitly (automatically) during object creation.
    (matching parameters)

6) every class will be having at-least one constructor.

7) you cant create any object without constructor execution.

8) when you do not write any constructor from your side, one zero arg
    constructor is internally supplied , called default constructor.

9) once you write your own constructor, default will lost.

10) usually they are used for initialization purpose.

11) java do not provide a copy constructor.

12) one constructor of a class can explicitly invoke (call) another constructor
      using this keyword.
	
	for invoking  a constructor using this keyword
	------------------------------------------------------------

	a) matching args constructor must exists.
	b) this must be the first statement of your constructor.
	c) we cant directly call more than one constructor.
	d) chaining is allowed.
	e) no recursive calls are allowed for constructors.
	f)  only a constructor can call another constructor
	    (you cant invoke a constructor within a method)
	    (though a method can be invoked within a constructor)

	
java do not support detructors.
